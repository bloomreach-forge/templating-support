## FAQ

#### Q: Why does someone want to use Handlebars or Thymeleaf instead of FreeMarker or JSP?

It is probably better to ask the person directly as we cannot imagine the reasons exactly in general.
However, we can imagine that some people are more accustomed to one or another templating technologies and sometimes
don't feel comfortable with FreeMarker or JSP.
It could be more cost effective for them to adopt a different view template technology such as
[Handlebars.java](https://github.com/jknack/handlebars.java) or
[Thymeleaf](https://www.thymeleaf.org/).

#### Q: Does Handlebars or Thymeleaf Template Supporting modules allows us to use equivalent features to HST-2 JSP Tab Libraries?

Yes. Both template supporting modules do. See the documentation of each module for more detail.
